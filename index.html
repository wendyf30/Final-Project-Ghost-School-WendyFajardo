			Instructions<br>
			<br>
      <p>The first step is by touching the easy column and touching the image for 5 seconds and  see what changed in the objects in the  image and then you let go and see the original image and look at the objects again  and try to guess what  changed in the image and if any objects changed also what  that you saw for 5 seconds once you are done trying to find the difference in the two images. You get back to the other image that changed and see what you got right and what you got wrong while you were guessing.You'll be repeating the steps for levels medium and hard.Once you are done playing all the levels you are done i hope you enjoy playing my game.
 </p>
